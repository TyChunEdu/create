        Being a Writer in My Discipline
    </h1>
    <p>
        Every discipline requires writing skills in some way. Yes, writing is of course important
        outside any discipline, especially in the world of the internet where media literacy is
        essential, but there are various ways of communicating through writing. In addition, there
        are literacy concepts that we must continuously apply to succeed in our discipline.

                Reading like a writer was the very first discussion we had, and just from the discussion
                alone I had a feeling I would be really excited to contribute to more discussions in the
                future.

                One of the biggest realizations for me was that I had been reading like a (song)writer while
                listening to music. When someone thinks of reading music, they usually mean reading a
                music's score or lyrics. What I proposed is that I am able to analyze aspects of the music
                and take into consideration traditional writing concepts, like diction, intended audience,
                context, etc. just by listening to it. It's the difference between reading text on a page
                and hearing text being sung along with the music, while taking in how that lyric fits in
                with the entire song. Tone and structure are both writing concepts and music concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was nice to be able to show people the craft of songwriting and composition, and how
                in-depth it can get beyond whether a song "sounds good" or not. It's a discipline in itself,
                and I hope discussing it has allowed others to be more creative. Whether it's noting the
                song's form and storytelling, its ability to provide imagery through diction,
                its internal vs. external details, its context and complexity, or the vocal choice, it gets
                people to think, "What if this was different? Is it effective? How would I do it
                differently? <b>What is this song missing?</b>" This is all parallel to reading like a
                writer. As I like to say, music is its own language.

            "I agree. Sometimes when I focus on the lyrics after hearing it over and over again, if
            a
            lyric is kinda distasteful or questionable as you mentioned, I would stop listening to
            it. No matter how catchy the beat is. One of those songs was Step Back by Got the Beat
            and I enjoyed it, until I saw the lyrics. Now, even though I like the beat and I
            remember the beat, I still can't bring myself to press play on it, because of how
            questionable the lyrics are. I kind of can't unsee it and un-interpret it, since in a
            discussion with someone, they brought up how the lyrics were a bunch of girls fighting
            over a boy and essentially treating said guy as the trophy to be had."

        I think this was a memorable conversation to have. We often hear songs with very disgusting
        lyrics, but we overlook them (or "overhear" them I guess) because the composition sounds
        good. Yes, music often pushes the boundaries of "what's allowed," but only for specific
        artistic purposes. As I mentioned, I'm more critiquing "lyrics seem tone-deaf, distasteful,
        or questionable, [where] it can stain the emotions I want to feel." This is well-known
        concept and critique of music where lyrics that are meant to be creative can negatively
        impact the quality of the song.

            <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                Do you think it would be a better strategy to write music that captures the audience of
                many or would it be better to try and find a niche that you can really cater to?
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere in the middle. In my opinion, it's not worth aiming to get the largest
            audience, as you'll end up disappointing yourself if someone does not like your song.
            You may also write your song in a less authentic way in order to 'please the masses.'
            Pretty much every song has an intended audience, and it is rarely just 'the general
            public.' How large/wide that intended audience is the decision of the artist. That being
            said, I have to consider how the song would sound to someone that isn't who I'm writing
            for. There is plenty of music I love that is definitely not meant to be for me. That is
            usually because I can relate to or understand the song in some way, or I like the
            aesthetic.

        <p>
            <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                Involving the senses in a song seems like an interesting idea. I can think of many
                examples with vision and touch and hearing but I can't think of much with taste and
                smell. Have you written or heard songs that involve those senses? If so, how?
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            All the time! A song that's in-your-face about it is 'Taste' by Sabrina Carpenter. A
            more subtle example is 'all-american bitch' by Olivia Rodrigo, 'I'm as fresh as the
            air.' Because they're rare, they usually have more of an impact on songs, at least from
            my experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                I also like the concept of internal and external details that you talked about.
                Though the song that you are writing sounds pretty heavy. Hope you're doing alright
                man.
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Music is meant to be raw and vulnerable! A common thought is, 'the best songs come from
            trauma.' Listen to 'ceilings' by Lizzy McAlpine and 'Lucky' by Halsey. I appreciate you
            being worried though!
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="padding-left: 20px;">
                The 'lyrics are not songs without music' made me think. A lot of poetry sounds like
                lyrics without music. Do you think they could be made into songs by adding music to
                it?
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Poetry and music lyrics can be similar, although there are notable differences. Songs
            have a certain musical flow (e.g. rhythm) and structure (form) that poems do not.
            They're meant to be read (and processed as they're reading). They probably could be made
            into songs given the right artist, and it's been done before, but some poems would
            definitely be incredibly difficult to make musical.

        I was more than willing to answer David's questions. When it comes to songwriting, or any
        other field/discipline I care about, I am my most confident and talkative self. I also
        realized during senior year that I liked giving younger students advice, essentially being
        a mentor. They were genuinely good questions that made me think, and I felt confident

            Reflecting upon my time in college as my final semester comes to an end, it is so easy
            to have regrets. Classic 'post-college blues.' I have made huge mistakes during these 4
            years that definitely in my perspective 'set me back,' so much so that they have
            overshadowed the many great accomplishments I have had here. These mistakes set my
            self-confidence to an all time low, and led me to distrust myself. These last couple
            years have been significant for my personal development where I had to unlearn these
            negative beliefs about myself and allow myself to grow in the future. There are a number
            of things I wish I did during college, but I needed to realize that I am in a good place
            and where I need to be, right here, right now. Maybe the unreached goals I set for
            myself do not have to end after college. I think this was all a lot to take in, since
            life can sometimes feel like there's constantly an hourglass with sand going down the
            tube.

            I want to discuss Unlearning to Learn by Gupte. I totally forgot that Yoda taught this
            concept! Star Wars aside, I found the write-up very profound. In a world of rapid
            change, we are always slow to adapt to it. I understand that it is difficult for people
            to change as they get older and issues become more complex, but we are failing to
            conquer biases and unlearn outdated understandings. It often feels like we're going
            backwards, making our world more like how it was hundreds of years ago because we do not
            want to change and have forgotten how important the progress we have made so far is. We
            take everything that we do not physically see or pay attention to for granted, not
            realizing that it took time and effort to get ourselves to where we are today, so much
            so that we are willing to go back, as the article says, to where we have always done it.
            We let fear conquer us, rather than unlearn the past and learn to adapt to the future.
            Maybe we focus so much on changing the world 'with our bare hands,' and completely
            disregard the idea that we need to change."

        I took interesting approach to giving an example of unlearning to learn. It is difficult
        to really discuss it, since it is personal and touches on the not so great parts of my
        life. How do I be specific, despite the very personal details I would have to reveal?
        You could guess what my solution is. Songwriting has its way of allowing artists to be
        very specific with their experiences. Not only do those experiences become a part of
        an art piece, but they allow people to connect to them better. Music emphasizes that
        everyone goes through similar struggles. Even if the super-specific details are left
        out, generally people gain a good enough understanding of that experience, perhaps
        through the music composition which illustrates the artist's emotions.

        I don't think I realized that people had actually replied to my post. I don't think I
        checked the discussion since it was a reflection post. Eshani and Thomas asked if my
        change in perspective had affected my hope for future and my aspirations. It absolutely
        has. I now have the mindset of "maybe it doesn't have to end just yet." I was able to
        really open my eyes to opportunities outside college, and how exciting the future could
        be. I have a lot of goals for myself, and I have gained confidence in myself that I will
        achieve them.

        My last paragraph in this post was hinting at social issues. The article immediately
        made me think of how not being able to unlearn to learn has worsened social justice.
        I think our society's resistance to change irked me enough that I just had to write
        that paragraph.

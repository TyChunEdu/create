    <h1>
        Being a Writer in My Discipline
    </h1>
    <p>
        Every discipline requires writing skills in some way. Yes, writing is of course important
        outside any discipline, especially in the world of the internet where media literacy is
        essential, but there are various ways of communicating through writing. In addition, there
        are literacy concepts that we must continuously apply to succeed in our discipline.

        RLW

    <p>
        Reading like a writer was the very first discussion we had, and just from the discussion
        alone I had a feeling I would be really excited to contribute to more discussions in the
        future.

            "...the more I think about it, I have subconsciously been RLW for a while..."

        One of the biggest realizations for me was that I had been reading like a (song)writer while
        listening to music. When someone thinks of reading music, they usually mean reading a
        music's score or lyrics.

    <h1>
        Being a Writer in My Discipline
    </h1>
    <p>
        Every discipline requires writing skills in some way. Yes, writing is of course important
        outside any discipline, especially in the world of the internet where media literacy is
        essential, but there are various ways of communicating through writing. In addition, there
        are literacy concepts that we must continuously apply to succeed in our discipline.

        Reading like a writer was the very first discussion we had, and just from the discussion
        alone I had a feeling I would be really excited to contribute to more discussions in the
        future.

        One of the biggest realizations for me was that I had been reading like a (song)writer while
        listening to music. When someone thinks of reading music, they usually mean reading a
        music's score or lyrics. What I proposed is that I am able to analyze aspects of the music
        and take into consideration traditional writing concepts, like diction, intended audience,
        context, etc. just by listening to it. It's the difference between reading text on a page
        and hearing text being sung along with the music, while taking in how that lyric fits in
        with the entire song. Tone and structure are both writing concepts and music concepts.

        It was nice to be able to show people the craft of songwriting and composition, and how
        in-depth it can get beyond whether a song "sounds good" or not. It's a discipline in itself,
        and I hope discussing it has allowed others to be more creative. Whether it's noting the
        song's form and storytelling, its ability to provide imagery through diction,
        its internal vs. external details, its context and complexity, or the vocal choice, it gets
        people to think, "What if this was different? Is it effective? How would I do it
        differently? <b>What is this song missing?</b>" This is all parallel to reading like a
        writer. As I like to say, music is its own language.

    <h1>
        Where Arts & Technology Collide
    </h1>
    <p>
        I will always say that I would not be able to pursue computer science without some creative
        or art aspect mixed with it. The stereotype is that students who study computer science
        obsess over technology and lack diverse interests, which is the complete opposite of who
        I am. Whenever I was asked for my favorite subject, I would usually answer with four or
        more of them, as I could never choose one and leave out the others. In addition to computer
        science and music, I love Spanish, especially when it integrates with music. I listen to
        Spanish-speaking music all the time. I also love creative writing, and it really came from
        the early years of high school and became a part of who I am. In retrospect, I'm surprised
        I did not foresee myself integrating music and writing, as it seems like an obvious path. I
        guess I thought, since I was pursuing computer science and music, that I would not have the
        time or concentration to utilize the other subjects I value so much. However, as I went
        through college having not written anything <b>for me</b> outside of classes, I realized
        how I desperately I had been wanting to write, and it caused this surge of desire to write
        songs in 2023.

        My Efforts at Northeastern
    </h2>
    <p>
        While I was on co-op in New York, bouncing between my apartment in Boston and my house
        in New York (my internship was hybrid), I had realized that my time at Northeastern really
        was coming to a close, and I wanted to leave my mark in the university with the idea of
        an umbrella organization for all the arts and technology clubs on campus. The
        Interdisciplinary Arts & Technology Council was proposed and spearheaded by me throughout
        the rest of 2024. A lot of the issues and missed opportunities I felt were present between
        these interdisciplinary clubs aligned almost one to one with what was decribed in our
        reading on interdisciplinarity, <i>A Time for Interdisciplinarity</i>.

                "I agree with the criticism that university departments hold back interdisciplinary
                development. One of the main struggles in developing the IATC (Interdisciplinary Arts &
                Technology Council) is that most organizations at Northeastern need to be under a single
                college (or center/overseer). After my discussions with student government and others, I
                have concluded that this umbrella organization would require support from more than just
                faculty of a single college (which creates more hurdles in the process). Although
                Northeastern already has interdisciplinarity incorporated into its academics (e.g.
                combined majors and programs), the concept of facilitating collaborations and networking
                between clubs (i.e. outside classes), especially those who belong to different colleges,
                continues to be missed potential, blocked by the inherent divide of disciplines by the
                university."

        I was unfortunately not able to get the IATC into fruition, mainly due to scheduling issues.
        However, I hope that the faculty in the music department can one day pass down the torch
        to someone else with the same drive and passion as me...
    </p>
    <p>
        In that same post, I discussed how incredibly interdisciplinary music technology is, but I
        also mentioned how I tried pushing for a more integrative curriculum for my major, and how
        there were still hurdles that I needed to overcome. Combined majors at Northeastern are at
        times inflexible, and I mentioned how in the industries that have music technology, it's
        the complete opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the course curriculum changes I proposed are going through a process right now,
        so hopefully they are eventually approved. Along with the IATC, this was also my way of
        leaving a mark on the university.

        The Power of Interdisciplinarity
    </h2>
    <div class="quote">
        <p>
            "I want to reaffirm my perspective on interdisciplinarity. Even at lower levels of
            education, disciplines intersect all time. Physics and calculus go hand & hand, social
            studies often relies on English skills, and digital art has become more prominent over
            the years, requiring both artistic and technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nearly all my classes were interdisciplinary. For my composition classes, I had to use
            my expertise in physics and engineering to recreate real-life instruments using
            synthesizers. Right now, I am taking a class in digital audio signal processing (DSP),
            programming in C to perform operations on audio signals (requiring an understanding of
            computer science, physics, and digital audio). I have taken game-focused CS classes,
            allowing me to actually incorporate game audio, design principles, and game
            development/industry standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think it's less about whether or not disciplines should cross more often (since they
            inherently do) and more about how interdisciplinary education is taught."

        Interdisciplinarity has always been important to me (clearly). It's what allows for diverse
        perspectives, and it's where passions intersect. While having strong focuses on specific
        disciplines is understandable, I've noticed that it's not always enough for students to
        merely pursue, for example, a degree in computer science. Nowadays, some companies want
        specific backgrounds. Working at a medical sensor company may require signal processing.
        Game companies often require game design knowledge in addition to software development
        principles. This is of course not always the case, but the more competitive the industry
        gets, the more specialized and interdisciplinary they want their employees to be. While
        I don't completely agree with companies trying to find the perfect candidate that doesn't
        exist, but I don't think specializing in a particular interdiscipline is a bad idea. At
        a certain point an interdiscipline becomes a whole discipline itself, like computer science
        or music technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        I thought this was interesting to look back upon, since I was essentially making an
        argument and believed strongly in it. Me giving the various examples of disciplines
        intersecting illustrates how much I recognize interdisciplinarity and how much I think and
        care about it. I value being able to voice a perspective, provide examples, and contribute
        to good conversations. Especially in the era of the internet, data and sources or more
        important than ever.

            "...This perspective was shaped early on by my experience in a Montessori school, where
            learning was inherently interdisciplinary. Subjects weren’t taught in isolation but as
            interconnected concepts. Instead of learning math, science, and history separately, we
            explored overarching themes that blended them together..."

        Before reading Chandler's post, I had no idea Montessori schools were a thing, and I was
        really intrigued to see how one would be in person. It made me think about how a student's
        strength in one subject could help them be stronger in other subjects that they would
        perhaps otherwise dislike. It could expose fields and interdisciplines that students have
        never heard of before, increasing their interest in the disciplines they entail. Personally,
        social studies became way more interesting once I realized how important and relevant it
        is. I assume this would be similar to how a student would feel if they greatly dislike a
        subject at first. I think people would be more interested in learning imaginary numbers if
        they know how it was used in sound engineering (or maybe that's just me)...

            "I think it is also important to note how many disciplines have been 'clashing,'
            particularly art vs. tech fields. I would say it's essentially a battle between depth
            and efficiency. The large focus on efficiency in our society today has caused various
            problems, especially recently. Most notably:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is little consideration for the (financial and moral) consequences; 'pursuing
                a goal despite core issues that could arise'
            </li>
            <li>The loss of quality and diversity, especially due to the lack of collaboration (or
                compromise) between art and technology
            </li>
            <li>The lack of creativity, which actually undermines innovation (which is the complete
                opposite of what we generally want)"

        I thought this was interesting since I think in my midterm reflection I had said I didn't
        pushed for social justice at that point. Looking back to this, as well as my reply to Nora's
        reply this post, I was very much trying to address a social issue here. My points here
        addressed how lacking diverse perspectives and disciplines lead to ethical issues, an
        over-prioritization of efficiency, and less innovation. There are very serious consequences
        of constantly pushing for efficiency, especially with tech undermining art, and I think
        some of the most well-known companies that are doing this are starting to slowly recognize
        it...

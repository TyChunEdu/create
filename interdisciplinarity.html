    <h1>
        Where Arts & Technology Collide
    </h1>
    <p>
        I will always say that I would not be able to pursue computer science without some creative
        or art aspect mixed with it. The stereotype is that students who study computer science
        obsess over technology and lack diverse interests, which is the complete opposite of who
        I am. Whenever I was asked for my favorite subject, I would usually answer with four or
        more of them, as I could never choose one and leave out the others. In addition to computer
        science and music, I love Spanish, especially when it integrates with music. I listen to
        Spanish-speaking music all the time. I also love creative writing, and it really came from
        the early years of high school and became a part of who I am. In retrospect, I'm surprised
        I did not foresee myself integrating music and writing, as it seems like an obvious path. I
        guess I thought, since I was pursuing computer science and music, that I would not have the
        time or concentration to utilize the other subjects I value so much. However, as I went
        through college having not written anything <b>for me</b> outside of classes, I realized
        how I desperately I had been wanting to write, and it caused this surge of desire to write
        songs in 2023.

        My Efforts at Northeastern
    </h2>
    <p>
        While I was on co-op in New York, bouncing between my apartment in Boston and my house
        in New York (my internship was hybrid), I had realized that my time at Northeastern really
        was coming to a close, and I wanted to leave my mark in the university with the idea of
        an umbrella organization for all the arts and technology clubs on campus. The
        Interdisciplinary Arts & Technology Council was proposed and spearheaded by me throughout
        the rest of 2024. A lot of the issues and missed opportunities I felt were present between
        these interdisciplinary clubs aligned almost one to one with what was decribed in our
        reading on interdisciplinarity, <i>A Time for Interdisciplinarity</i>.
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
        <p>
            "I agree with the criticism that university departments hold back interdisciplinary
            development. One of the main struggles in developing the IATC (Interdisciplinary Arts &
            Technology Council) is that most organizations at Northeastern need to be under a single
            college (or center/overseer). After my discussions with student government and others, I
            have concluded that this umbrella organization would require support from more than just
            faculty of a single college (which creates more hurdles in the process). Although
            Northeastern already has interdisciplinarity incorporated into its academics (e.g.
            combined majors and programs), the concept of facilitating collaborations and networking
            between clubs (i.e. outside classes), especially those who belong to different colleges,
            continues to be missed potential, blocked by the inherent divide of disciplines by the
            university."

        In that same post, I discussed how incredibly interdisciplinary music technology, but I
        also mentioned how I tried pushing for a more integrative curriculum for my major, and how
        there were still hurdles that I needed to overcome. Combined majors at Northeastern are at
        times inflexible, and I mentioned how in the industries that have music technology, it's
        the complete opposite.

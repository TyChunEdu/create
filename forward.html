  <h1>
    The Long Journey Ahead
  </h1>
  <p>
    I'm surprised how vividly I remember the work in this class. It's incredible how these past
    several weeks really touched on topics I was genuinely interested in. For me, it propelled my
    love for reading and writing, and it reminded me how much both mattered to me throughout high
    school. To tell you the truth, I had emailed my 10th grade English teacher during freshman year
    essentially proposing that I would continue doing WWAs, only to later realize that high school
    was slowly becoming only a memory as I evolved into an adult in a vastly different environment.
    While songwriting helped to fulfill this hunger to write, life came in the way of me dedicating
    enough time to it. This class allowed me to do just that, and it made me feel confident that I
    would be finishing my college years with a bang.

    I had taken the technically difficult courses out of the way early so that I could really enjoy
    my senior semester. The two technology-focused classes allowed me to gain more perspective on
    the industry, learn new technical skills, and feel like I can really do and create whatever I
    want. This class and my computing and social issues philosophy course, Knowledge in a Digital
    World, addressed very relevant concepts and issues. They were a reminder that my career is more
    than the titles or money I make. It's about the change I am able to make to improve the world
    for the better. The discussions I've had in both have made me feel stronger in world of social
    struggles, misinformation, and AI.

    What Next?

  <p>
    As with other people in the class, I will be graduating in a few weeks. It really hasn't sunk in
    yet.

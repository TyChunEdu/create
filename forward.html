  <h1>
    The Long Journey Ahead
  </h1>
  <p>
    I'm surprised how vividly I remember the work in this class. It's incredible how these past
    several weeks really touched on topics I was genuinely interested in. For me, it propelled my
    love for reading and writing, and it reminded me how much both mattered to me throughout high
    school. To tell you the truth, I had emailed my 10th grade English teacher during freshman year
    essentially proposing that I would continue doing WWAs, only to later realize that high school
    was slowly becoming only a memory as I evolved into an adult in a vastly different environment.
    While songwriting helped to fulfill this hunger to write, life came in the way of me dedicating
    enough time to it. This class allowed me to do just that, and it made me feel confident that I
    would be finishing my college years with a bang.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had taken the technically difficult courses out of the way early so that I could really enjoy
    my senior semester. The two technology-focused classes allowed me to gain more perspective on
    the industry, learn new technical skills, and feel like I can really do and create whatever I
    want. This class and my computing and social issues philosophy course, Knowledge in a Digital
    World, addressed very relevant concepts and issues. They were a reminder that my career is more
    than the titles or money I make. It's about the change I am able to make to improve the world
    for the better. The discussions I've had in both have made me feel stronger in world of social
    struggles, misinformation, and AI.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What Next?
  </h2>
  <p>
    As with other people in the class, I will be graduating in a few weeks. It really hasn't sunk in
    yet. The future is a little scary. The job market, especially for computer science majors, is
    not great. I genuinely don't know where I'll be in a year. I have my apartment in Boston until
    September. What do I do in the meantime besides just sitting with my computer mass applying for
    jobs and grinding coding questions?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well one of the main goals I have is to perform an original song and release an album. Life will
    have slowed down with no work of any kind, and I have already started recording vocals. I think
    this class has made me really think about "songwriting for progress" and my ability to create
    more direct ways to combat the pressing issues of our time.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I was surprised to have gained is also confidence in my words. I have stage fright, so
    performing in front of a crowd is absolutely terrifying to me. Not only is it about my vocal
    performance, but also the words <b>I</b> wrote. It's very different from performing someone
    else's song. However, reading people's replies to what I've had to say has allowed me to better
    trust in my words and my voice, and in turn, trust myself. It's allowed me to think that maybe
    people actually would like to hear what I have to say, that my voice is meaningful and that it
    matters. That leads to the third goal I have for the summer: to connect with more people.
    Confidence in writing and my voice has given me confidence to engage with people in real life,
    and to not hide who I am from others.
  </p>
  <p>
    I will always love storytelling, through music, games, films, and TV shows, and I want to
    really get back into reading books and writing stories. I want to go to places regularly to
    share these experiences with others. Music will always be my #1, but I hope I get the
    opportunity to contribute to greater creative works that tell a deep and profound story.
  </p>
  <p>
    This all has given me excitement in an environment of uncertainty. I hope that where ever I end
    up being, it's in an incredibly interdisciplinary role and field, and that they are fulfilling
    our social responsibility to push for change and justice for all. There's a whole a lot out
    there just waiting for me to discover, and I can't wait to crush it out of the park.
  </p>

    Thank you to all my professors this semester. I would probably this is my favorite semester
    of college ever, as I've genuinely improved as a person and as a professional. I hope to keep

    the future.

        We All Deserve a Voice
    </h1>
    <p>
        2025 has been a rough year, and I hate to say it, but there's not really any signs of it
        getting better any time soon. However, what has been an incredible help this semester is
        my discussions with my peers and even my professors. Our discussions on disciplines' impact
        on social justice were well-timed, and I greatly enjoyed reflecting upon music's role
        in advocating for change, throughout history and possibly by me in the future...

    <h2>
        An Escape to a Distorted Reality
    </h2>
    <p>
        The core idea I was illustrating is that people absorbing certain media sources are doing so
        to escape from the scary ever-evolving world, causing their reality to be distorted and be
        opposed to any kind of progressive change.

        As I discussed in the post, while I added sources to some of the claims I was making, people
        tend to not really care about research and credibility (which is scary and sad). I decided
        to take a different approach and essentially logic my way through my reasoning in a way that
        is effective and understandable. The goal with talking to people with beliefs that harm
        others (and themselves) is to get people to at least be introduced to the conversation.
        Sometimes it just takes one person to put two and two together, especially with "evidence"
        they can't deny since it's actually how they experience the world (most of the time). It
        is an issue most of us cannot avoid, since these beliefs are sometimes ones held by our own
        family members, particularly older generations.

        I didn't expect my music lyrics to get such positive feedback. Songs are scary to write
        and show people, and I wrote that piece based on my real experiences. I really didn't have a
        lot of time to write it, but I still wanted to put as much thought into it as possible. Any
        song I'm writing "needs" to be of quality that I'm satisfied with, which is a lot of
        pressure, but in turn makes me more proud of the work I'm able to do as a musician. This is
        one of my favorite creative compositions I've made for this class, and I guess it made
        realize how badly I needed to compose lyrics on this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope my posts in this topic allowed people to better recognize this mainstream form
        of creativity as a way to better connect people, especially to sever the generational
        divide that's so present in modern families today.

            "I would say music has always been a tool for raising awareness, but I think that songs should be addressing social issues more, especially with the current state of the world right now. It is very easy for music to get lost in the entertainment part of the music industry, when in reality what we need right now more than ever is relatability, unity, and understanding."

        What's kind of crazy is a lot of people don't really get lyrics, that is, when someone
        else explains the lyrics to them, they just don't get it. I really do think we get tied
        up in music sounding good, and while that's fine and all, music has to actually <b>mean</b>
        something and be effective in communicating it. There's power in the composition, but
        there's also power in the words. Together, they can connect and unify people. I hope to
        be able to do this in my songwriting, and I hope artists do so more often as well.

            "I appreciate the kind words. I find that music and writing allow me to express myself better than simple conversation/speech. I feel like my mind is "colorful" but very internal. Music and writing will always be a part of my life, and it'll be a focus for me after classes end and after I graduate this year.

            The song in retrospect gave me the vibes of 1984 with how people get so locked into their propaganda machines. Media is incredibly difficult to navigate, and what I've also noticed is people who can no longer live in the moment, as they're lost in a dream they don't really want. This applies to news sources, but also gambling and video game addiction. Not only does it push the people in their lives away, but it prevents them from reaching other opportunities and moments in life.

            Music is my way of contributing to the world beyond technological innovation, which has been close to losing its human nature. For me, every connection from music matters."

        We All Deserve a Voice

        2025 has been a rough year, and I hate to say it, but there's not really any signs of it
        getting better any time soon. However, what has been an incredible help this semester is
        my discussions with my peers and even my professors. Our discussions on disciplines' impact
        on social justice were well-timed, and I greatly enjoyed reflecting upon music's role
        in advocating for change, throughout history and possibly by me in the future...

    <h2>
        An Escape to a Distorted Reality
    </h2>
    <p>
        The core idea I was illustrating is that people absorbing certain media sources are doing so
        to escape from the scary ever-evolving world, causing their reality to be distorted and be
        opposed to any kind of progressive change.

        <p>
            And so his eyes lock onto the screen<br>
            Being sold someone else's sensational dream<br>
            Will he ever escape, will he ever see<br>
            And care for reality
        </p>

        I didn't expect this piece to get such positive feedback. Songs are scary to write and show
        people, and I wrote that piece based on my real experiences. I really didn't have a lot of
        time to write it, but I still wanted to put as much thought into it as possible. Any song
        I'm writing "needs" to be of quality that I'm satisfied with, which is a lot of pressure,
        but in turn makes me more proud of the work I'm able to do as a musician.

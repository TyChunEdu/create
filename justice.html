    <h1>
        We All Deserve a Voice
    </h1>
    <p>
        2025 has been a rough year, and I hate to say it, but there's not really any signs of it
        getting better any time soon. However, what has been an incredible help this semester is
        my discussions with my peers and even my professors. Our discussions on disciplines' impact
        on social justice were well-timed, and I greatly enjoyed reflecting upon music's role
        in advocating for change, throughout history and possibly by me in the future...
    </p>
    <h2>
        An Escape to a Distorted Reality
    </h2>
    <p>
        The core idea I was illustrating is that people absorbing certain media sources are doing so
        to escape from the scary ever-evolving world, causing their reality to be distorted and be
        opposed to any kind of progressive change.

        As I discussed in the post, while I added sources to some of the claims I was making, people
        tend to not really care about research and credibility (which is scary and sad). I decided
        to take a different approach and essentially logic my way through my reasoning in a way that
        is effective and understandable. I essentially provided strong straight-forward examples.
        The goal with talking to people with beliefs that harm
        others (and themselves) is to get people to at least be introduced to the conversation.
        Sometimes it just takes one person to put two and two together, especially with "evidence"
        they can't deny since it's actually how they experience the world (most of the time). It
        is an issue most of us cannot avoid, since these beliefs are sometimes ones held by our own
        family members, particularly older generations.

        I didn't expect my music lyrics to get such positive feedback. Songs are scary to write
        and show people, and I wrote that piece based on my real experiences. I really didn't have a
        lot of time to write it, but I still wanted to put as much thought into it as possible. Any
        song I'm writing "needs" to be of quality that I'm satisfied with, which is a lot of
        pressure, but in turn makes me more proud of the work I'm able to do as a musician. This is
        one of my favorite creative compositions I've made for this class, and I guess it made
        realize how badly I needed to compose lyrics on this topic.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope my posts in this topic allowed people to better recognize this mainstream form
        of creativity as a way to better connect people, especially to sever the generational
        divide that's so present in modern families today.

            "I would say music has always been a tool for raising awareness, but I think that songs
            should be addressing social issues more, especially with the current state of the world
            right now. It is very easy for music to get lost in the entertainment part of the music
            industry, when in reality what we need right now more than ever is relatability, unity,
            and understanding."

        What's kind of crazy is a lot of people don't really get lyrics, that is, when someone
        else explains the lyrics to them, they just don't get it. I really do think we get tied
        up in music sounding good, and while that's fine and all, music has to actually <b>mean</b>
        something and be effective in communicating it. There's power in the composition, but
        there's also power in the words. Together, they can connect and unify people. I hope to
        be able to do this in my songwriting, and I hope artists do so more often as well.

            "Hi Tyler,
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks for being open and honest about how you were scared to write and share your
            music with us. I think being nervous or scared about something also means that you are
            extremely passionate about it. </p>
        <p>
            Your post does a great job encapsulating the fact that older generations have the 'this
            is how we've always done it' sentiment. This can be incredibly harmful to many people,
            especially in terms of social justice, because it implies that the individual believes
            that they are 100% right and is not willing to have an open mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love the line 'being sold someone else's sensational dream', because it is so true of
            essentially all social media posts. One of the greatest downfalls of social media that
            is fuels comparison between people. One may see a post of their friends on vacation, or
            with their partner, and immediately envy the life that individual lives. People think
            that what they see of others is what they should achieve for themselves when in reality
            it might not even be what they want at the end of the day. It should be stressed to
            people, especially those active on social media, that they need to be more mindful of
            what <i>they really want (to do) , not what they think they should (be doing).</i>"

    <p>
        It meant a lot to hear from Lizzie that she recognized my passion for music. People tend to
        roll their eyes when you tell them "I'm passionate about _" (perhaps they prefer show not
        tell).
    </p>
    <p>
        I hate the "this is how we've always done it" argument, especially with how much the world
        has changed (and how people don't realize it) since, say, 200 years ago. It's why the
        unlearning to learn discussion was so important to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like the lyric "being sold someone else's sensational dream" too :) It happens to often
        where people's beliefs come from other people, and not themselves. Too often are they told
        what to think, who to blame, and what's good and bad for them. It's how hate spreads and how
        people ultimately push for changes that directly harm them.

            "I appreciate the kind words. I find that music and writing allow me to express myself
            better than simple conversation/speech. I feel like my mind is 'colorful' but very
            internal. Music and writing will always be a part of my life, and it'll be a focus for
            me after classes end and after I graduate this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The song in retrospect gave me the vibes of <i>1984</i> with how people get so locked
            into their propaganda machines. Media is incredibly difficult to navigate, and what I've
            also noticed is people who can no longer live in the moment, as they're lost in a dream
            they don't really want. This applies to news sources, but also gambling and video game
            addiction. Not only does it push the people in their lives away, but it prevents them
            from reaching other opportunities and moments in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Music is my way of contributing to the world beyond technological innovation, which has
            been close to losing its human nature. For me, every connection from music matters."

        Songwriting has been my way of expressing my colorfulness beyond how I may seem. I really
        like art and animation. My favorite colors in order of most to least favorite are yellow,
        pink, blue, purple, and red. My point to me saying that is songwriting allows people to see
        that I am a person just like everyone else, and that I can be expressive in my own creative
        way beyond normal (perhaps surface level) conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
        It can feel like our world is turning into <i>1984</i>... I also despise AI being used to
        generate "original" art to replace artists, like musicians or animators.

            "I think what I've found interesting is the differences in how blunt certain issues are
            addressed in different art pieces. I remember my visits to the MFA, and sometimes the
            message trying to be conveyed require context that I could read the description, while
            others were very obvious and were crafted without any sense of fear or restriction."

        I wanted to reference this again since it implies that there's this "daringness" to art.
        It's kind of what "Escape" is and why I was kind of scared to write it. Some
        "in-your-face" art seems to be incredibly effective. I do however know that there is a
        limit to how real you can be... too much can be disturbing...

    <h2>
        Reproductive & Mental Health
    </h2>
    <p>
        By far one of my favorite and most memorable posts was the one by Vishali. I generally don't
        like debating too much about reproductive rights, as it sometimes feels like I'm talking
        "for" women, rather than women voicing their perspectives themselves. In other words, it
        often feels like it's "not for me to tell." However, it's still a topic that's really
        important to me, especially considering that Roe v. Wade was overturned (which is bonkers
        by the way).
    </p>
    <div class="quote">
        <p>
            "Reproductive access has been under threat and women everywhere are at risk of losing
            access to necessary care. Professionals in the field of psychology have the
            responsibility of addressing the social justice issue of reproductive rights and access
            to equitable resources. It has been found that reproductive autonomy is linked to mental
            health and well-being (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10199416/). When there
            are barriers to reproductive healthcare, stigma around
            certain reproductive procedures, and legislative restrictions, mental well-being
            decreases and psychological distress increases. It is important to understand how lack
            of access to comprehensive reproductive care overwhelmingly affects marginalized
            populations, as they already have less access to physical and mental healthcare
            (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3540621/)."

        I think her letter really effectively addressed a perspective and argument that not many
        people, including myself, knew about. Mental health is really important to me, as I had to
        focus on it last year. <b>"Reproductive issues are a psychological issue"</b> is a really
        strong point, and it impacts me when I think about the women in my life, and how they could
        also be struggling (and how I could never imagine how they would feel). The letter was
        proactive and direct with what people can do right now to help women struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think this letter would also effective if it was read by the general public as well.
        Lack of reproductive freedom's impact on mental health will definitely be an issue I'll
        remember and one that I will be sure to bring more awareness to.

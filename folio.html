        Where My Writing Journey Started
    </h2>
    <div class="row">
        <p>
            In high school, I was a "subjectholic." While I was notably better and more comfortable with
            mathematics, the arts were and are incredibly important to me (so important that I would
            pursue a degree in computer science and <i>music</i>). I value every single teacher I had
            in high school, and I have talked to them during high school visits about how their classes
            are doing. My relationships with them have motivated me to care about their teaching,
            whether I liked the content of the class or not (and I think it helped me do well in their
            classes anyway).

            Among these subjects was English. My care for reading came during the start of 9th grade,
            where I discovered the <i>Arc of a Scythe</i> trilogy by Neal Shusterman and read the first
            book in the series during summer break. I eventually finished the series during early college
            (the books took a while to release). Today it is still one of my favorite book series of
            all time, and now I am stuck waiting for the TV series adaptation to release (by Universal
            on Peacock). In the meantime, my sister has been reading the series (since I have the
            complete collection) and her fan art of one of the characters was actually recently noticed
            by the author!
        </p>

            For me, writing was amplified during 10th great thanks to two English teachers then. We had
            to complete a weekly writing assignment (WWA) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. While 9th grade
            had similar weekly assignments, I was given to not have the teacher read my entries. Every
            WWA was read by one of the teachers, and it motivated me to care about what I was writing.
            Having an audience was incredibly important in my writing development. In 11th grade I took
            the very interesting AP class, English Language and Composition, which was genuinely a
            really cool class. My senior year, I had (one of) the teacherss I had for 10th grade. It was
            a more laid back class (since I wasn't taking AP Literature), but it was a nice finish to
            the high school English curriculum. I had to make an exit portfolio reflecting on the reading
            and writing I did in high school (kind of like what I am doing right now).

        Beyond the <i>Arc of a Scythe</i> series and WWAs, I had a great motivation for storytelling.
        I have felt the impacts of well-written stories, in books and through media. Some stories I
        love include <i>Arcane</i> and the animated <i>Spider-Verse</i> series. Storytelling has also
        motivated me to explore possibly composing for movies, for example, and to explore my music
        capabilities. At the start I was having fun listening to music by ear and scoring
        (arranging) it (which not many people have the ability to do). During college, I became very
        interested in singing and songwriting. I realized throughout the years that I best who I am
        through music, and crafting lyrics from my heart could allow me to better communicate my
        true self.

    <h2>
        Writing in College
    </h2>
    <p>
        Of course, writing in college didn't start with songwriting. I played the flute through
        high school, so I was in the NU concert band freshman year. I had to take First-Year
        Writing, and it wasn't anything too exciting. We had to post on a discussion board about
        a book we had to read, <i>They Say / I Say: The Moves That Matter in Academic Writing with
        Readings</i>. We had to write three essays, and we read <i>Stuck Rubber Baby</i>. While I
        think the topics were interesting, the class very much felt like a chore.
    </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div>
            <p>
                My journey in songwriting began in January 2023. I went through a lot during freshman year,
                and that later affected me throughout 2023. I had a desire to shpw my genuineness and communicate
                thoughts I've been having about my life and the world. It's much easier to be vulnerable and
                do all this though music. With my care for writing and music, songwriting was a natural
                intersection to pursue. My music journey evolved similar to my music listening journey. I
                recognized the power of lyrics more, but I also felt like there was a lot in music
                lyrics that was missing. That missing part is essentially my voice, and the perspectives
                that I have that are not necessarily unique, but are not really voiced in music today.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time of my life, lyrics were not too hard to come up with. Any time I had a
                point or phrase that came to me, I immediately wrote it down. In the summer of 2023
                especially, I also took pictures that I felt emphasized the beauty of world. Those slowly
                became song and album covers. As time went by, I had a long roadmap of songs I wanted to
                write, with a bunch of notes about what I would like to say in the song, how it should
                feel, and references I could make. Putting that all together was the challenge. Songwriting
                and composition can be a long process, and with co-op and classes, as well as my desire
                to make more connections in college, songwriting was always priority #1, but these other
                aspects just came in the way.

        My junior year went by too quickly. During the fall semester, I had to focus on one of the
        hardest courses in the Khoury computer science program. In the spring I took my music
        technology capstone (a year early) in case I did not receive a co-op for fall 2024. During
        the summer and the fall (2024), I ended getting an internship that later extended to a co-op
        at Major League Baseball. I also had to focus on my mental health. Needless to say it was a
        busy time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For my final semester, I had to take an advanced writing class. I value interdisciplinarity
        tremendously from high school, and it describes the very nature of my major. However, I had
        not heard of good experiences for the advanced writing classes from other students. I was
        naturally skeptical, but I hoped that the class would resonate with me in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in the Disciplines gave me a familiar feeling. Discussion
        boards reminded me of the WWAs I used to, but I was able to expand my audience from a
        single person to my peers. The topics were actually interesting and relevant to who I am.
        2025 is of course a year of not-so-good events in our world, and it increased my desire to
        have a voice, through writing to an audience and song (for the more vulnerable parts). This
        portfolio will take you on a journey through some of my favorite parts of the class, why
        they resonate with me so much, and how they motivate me today to continue writing in the
        form of music beyond my college years.
